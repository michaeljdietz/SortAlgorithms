# Sort Algorithms

A simple library of sort algorithms for PHP. More of a goof-off project to keep some less used skills/algorithms sharp.  Currently includes a Merge Sort and Quick Sort.

## Getting Started

Download the repo, and add require_once('path/to/library/DesiredAlgorithm.php') to your project.  You can use any of the sort algorithms with it's static "Sort" method.
See test.php for example usages.

### Prerequisites

PHP 5.x
